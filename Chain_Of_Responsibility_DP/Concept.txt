The chain of responsibility is a chain
of components who all get the chance 
to process a command or a query, 
optionaly having default processing
and an ability to terminate the process chain.

Command query separation
Means separating all the invocations of an entity
into 2 concepts: query and command.
Command -> asking for an action or change
Query -> asking for information without changing it
CQS -> having separate means of sending commands and queries

Example: 
If you want to access a field from an object
- send a message that states that you want a particular field
or
- send a command that states that you want to modify a field
using this concept you can have multiple listeners to the same
query or command that can alter the action or even termintate it.
